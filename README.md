  # 🐍 Snake Game (SFML based)

  ## 🎯 Objective
  The goal of this project is to build a graphical Snake Game using C++ and SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). The game provides an interactive GUI-based gaming experience where the player controls a snake to collect apples, grow in length, and avoid collisions with walls or itself.

  This project helps reinforce understanding of:

  - Game development basics  
  - Object movement and collision detection  
  - Event-driven programming  
  - Graphical rendering with SFML  
  - Keyboard event handling and game state management  

  ## 🚀 Features and Functionalities

  - 🎮 **Graphical Game Window** (1000x1000 px) using SFML  
  - 🔲 **Game Arena** with bordered play area  
  - 🐍 **Controllable Snake** using arrow keys / WASD keys  
  - 🍎 **Randomly Placed Apples** that increase the snake's length and score  
  - 🧠 **Score Tracking** displayed on screen in real-time  
  - ❌ **Game Over Detection**
    - Collision with walls  
    - Collision with self  
  - 🔄 **Game Restart Mechanism**: Press any key after game over to restart the game  
  - 🖼️ **Custom Background Image and Apple Sprite** for visual appeal  
  - 🔠 **Custom Font** used for title and text elements (score, game over message)
